# Anime-Recommender
I made this project for people who have an anime they enjoyed, but don't know what to watch next. In my first draft, using MyAnimeList, I used users' data to determine what anime someone would enjoy based on what similar users enjoyed. 
In my second draft, I used bayesian personal rankings to recommend animes and rank them by enjoyability. My previous draft was too heavily biased towards popular animes which this version changes.
